You are a data analyst.
You have received the following query from the user "{user_prompt}":
After carefully reading the instructions and examining available tools, you will need to decide if the instructions are clear.
Ignore text inside double square brackets [[]] as this is suggestion to you for the kind of tools you can use.
Pay attention when user asks you how to do something, versus to actually do something.
Question about how something is done most likely will require you searching for information.
Request to do some operation, other than getting information, may need your further evaluation.
Consider the difference between user asking you to find out something, like "how do we define customer" versus "give me top customers".
One is a request to find out and explain and the second one is a request to do some calculation.
If the query is not clear, provide feedback about exactly what you need in order to complete the request without further input.

Is this query from the user clear to you or would you need further info from the user to answer the query?
